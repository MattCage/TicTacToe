# Project TicTacToe
My first ever working HTML5 game, an evergreen classic. Inspired by (and written following) Marco Bruti's *Imparare Javascript, DOM, CSS e HTML5 con i Browser Game*.

This game is currently under development, so its appearance, features and experience can change during development.

Current version: *0.9.4*.

## How to run the game
Open `index.html`, from master directory, with a web browser of your choice.

## How To Play
In *Prj.TicTacToe* there are two players, X and O. Player 1 chooses what will be its mark, Player 2 will use the other mark. Click a blank space on the grid to mark it with your sign and try to be the first who gets three of same marks in a row.

## Compatibility
*Prj.TicTacToe* works on any device with a web browser installed.

**Note**: ~~At this moment, its planned UI works better on smartphones; the game runs on tablets, desktops etc. as well, but~~ [Now fixed on every device] final experience and appeal may (*will*, to be honest) vary.

This game works and has been tested on:
- Chrome (Android, Windows)
- Firefox (Windows)
- Internet Explorer (8+ on Windows)
- Opera (Windows)
- Vivaldi (TechPrev4 on Windows)

Developed and best viewed on Google Chrome.
