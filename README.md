# Project TicTacToe
My first ever working HTML5 game, an evergreen classic. Inspired by (and written following) Marco Bruti's *Imparare Javascript, DOM, CSS e HTML5 con i Browser Game*.
This game is currently under development, so its appearance, features and experience can change during development.
Current version: *0.9.0-b*.

## How to run the game
Open `index.html`, from master directory, with a web browser of your choice.

## How To Play
In *Prj.TicTacToe* there are two players, X and O. X is always the first player. Click a blank space on the grid to mark it with your sign and try to be the first who gets three of same marks in a row.

## Compatibility
*Prj.TicTacToe* works on any device which has a web browser installed.
**Note**: At this moment, its planned UI works better on smartphones. It runs also on tablets, desktops etc., but final experience and appeal may (*will*, to be honest) vary.
This game works and has been tested on:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer 8+
- Opera

Originally developed, and best viewed, on Google Chrome.
