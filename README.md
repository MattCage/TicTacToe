# Project TicTacToe
My first ever working HTML5 game, an evergreen classic. Inspired by (and written following) Marco Bruti's *Imparare Javascript, DOM, CSS e HTML5 con i Browser Game*

## How to run the game
Open `index.html`, from master's dicretory, with a web browser of your choice.

## How To Play
In TicTacToe there are two players, X and O. X is always the first player. Click a blank space on the grid to mark it with your sign and try to be the first who gets three of same marks in a row.
